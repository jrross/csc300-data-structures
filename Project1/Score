Functionally looks good so far.  I haven't dug into the code as it's early and
you'll probably redesign/refactor a couple times before you submit.

For something of this complexity there should be *frequent* commits.  Remember
that a commit isn't a push.  Every time you get something compiling or 
marginally working you should commit.  Don't lose a bunch of work because you
didn't do frequent commits.

If what this is really showing me is that one person is doing all the work then
that is going to be a problem.  If some of you are just not committing 
frequently then step up your game.
