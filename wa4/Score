Good job, Jeff.  Warnings are typically bugs waiting to happen.  This particular
warning is telling you that you're not assiging a nullptr to tail like you
might think you are.  The double == is comparison, not assignment.

   In this case I think you're safe since to satisfy the sucNode == nullptr
then head == nullptr and subsequent operations do not reference through tail
before it's made the correct value.
