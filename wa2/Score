Jeff,

    You code compiles but has warnings.  Warnings are usually bugs waiting to
happen so it's a good idea to clean them up before submitting code.

One comment is to use the define constants for a better approximation of things
like PI.

#include<cmath>
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
.
.
.
temp = (4.0 / 3.0) * M_PI * (radius * radius * radius);
instead of
temp = (4.0 / 3.0) * 3.14159 * (radius * radius * radius);

Also, the warnings are coming because you're not returning anything from
your overloaded operator<< friend functions.  Your interface says that you
will return an ostream& so you should do this:

ostream& operator<<(ostream &out, Cube &c)
{
	out << c.pc.pointGet(1) << "," << c.pc.pointGet(2) << "," <<
	c.pc.pointGet(3) << " with dimensions: " << c.x << "x" <<
	c.y << "x" << c.z;
        return out;                <<<<<<<<< add this line
}

Overall pretty good job.  Nice job on the function headers.

10/10
