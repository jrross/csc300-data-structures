SimpleFind2: Checks to see if I can insert a key/value pair then insert
             another key/value pair where the keys are the same.  I.E.
             testing what the replacement policy is for the insert function.
             (seg fault)

SimpleLF2: Checks to see if you're managing the load factor calculation after
           removing an item.

SimpleRemove: Requires that the end() member function was implemented as
              per the problem writeup.

Performance: Tries to insert all the words in the Tom Sawyer text into the
             hash, search for them, remove them and measure timing stats.
             (hangs)

It looks like you have most of the concepts down.  Your testing can use an
upgrade as your code doesn't appear to have been tested against some expected
use cases.
