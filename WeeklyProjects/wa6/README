Build the program by changing insert function in the WA6.cpp file so that it
performs AVL insertions.

The Makefile will build a main executable with the following command:

% make

Once you build the main executable, you can run it and a blank window will
open.  Enter integers followed by <enter> and the program will call the insert
routine followed by displaying the AVL tree that is created.  The input is
not very robust (i.e. typing number and backspacing).  No error checking so
if you put in letters instead of numbers the results are undefined.  The
display is meant as a way to help debug what your routine is doing.

The supplied insert function does just a regular BST insert (no balancing).
