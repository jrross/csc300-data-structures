- Program compiles without errors or warnings
- Escape key exits program
- 'X' button exits program
- Display events reported
- Key presses reported (-.5)
   - Key presses are lost when first pressing a key or switching from one
     key to another.  Example:

      - Start program press 'a' key

        Expected output:
           a key pressed at location: 243, 245
           Changed Display Dimensions
           No Actions.
        Actual output:
           Changed Display Dimensions
           No Actions.
           No Actions.

- Mouse click events reported (-.5)
   - Similar to results from pressing a key.  Reporting of events are
     delayed by one event

- Extra files (function.cpp) in the wa3 sub-directory
- No data structure used to store event history (parallel arrays)
- Events passed as parallel arrays
- Events recorded as strings
- Message selection done via if-else blocks

Would like to see more modularity
Would like to see separation of interface and implementation

Overall a good job, Jeff.  We'll do some code reviews next week to discuss
some things about the code that might be improved.
