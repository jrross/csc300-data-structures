Yes Makefile or compilation instructions included in repo
No  Program compiles without errors and warnings
functions.cpp: In function ‘void keyboard(unsigned char, int, int)’:
functions.cpp:28:9: warning: deleting object of abstract class type ‘event’ which has non-virtual destructor will cause undefined behaviour [-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor]
  delete ev;

- Application closes cleanly via upper right 'X' or <esc> key
No  Left mouse down click in window draws a filled red square at location (-1)
   - Red square always appears in the middle of display
Yes Typing character from keyboard renders letter in window at mouse location
- Program does not leak memory
------ Bonus -----
- Middle mouse down click draws green square at location
- Right mouse down click draws blue square at location
Yes <backspace> key clear the display of all squares and text (+.5)

Comments:
   - Text and graphics disappear when resizing window
   - Window is cleared before drawing new text/graphic
   - Mouse and kb events both have an x and y member data but they both
     derive from Event so it would be better to put them in Event
   - You have an x and y coordinate for mouse events, this simple change:

     y = h - y;
     DrawFilledRectangle(x-10, y-10, x+10, y+10, color);

     would place the square at the mouse click.
   - Calling a destructor on an object that is derived from an abstract
     base class can cause problems if the abstract base class does not have
     a virtual destructor.  Add this to your Event class:

        virtual ~Event() { }

     to prevent undefined behavior.

Generally a good job, Jeff.
