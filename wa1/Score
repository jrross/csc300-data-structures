Looks good, Jeff.  There will be quite a few weekly assignments so we'll 
organize the Weekly project with a sub-directory for each assignment just to
keep things separate.  I've made the change to the directory structure.

Commit message of 'Made a thing' probably not the most descriptive one I've
seen.
